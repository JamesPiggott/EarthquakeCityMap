# EarthquakeCityMaps version 1.0
Welcome to my EarthquakeCityMaps application built on the UnfoldingMaps library of Potsdam University.
Author: James Piggott

## Features
EarthquakeCityMap will display all recent earthquakes worldwide.


## Manual
To start the application compile the java code and run the EarthquakeCityMap class file
EarthquakeCityMap requires an Internet connection to use the Earthquake API feed, furthermore it is currently
set to use the Microsoft Aerial View API because the Google Maps API locks after too many requests.
